## Decision
The tenant will use a **strictly separated account model** consisting of:

- **Standard user accounts** for daily productivity
- **Dedicated administrative accounts** for privileged operations
- **Emergency access (break-glass) accounts** for recovery scenarios

Administrative privileges will **never** be exercised using standard user accounts.
Each account type has a distinct purpose, risk profile, and security treatment.
