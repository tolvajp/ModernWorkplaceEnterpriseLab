# Decision Log – Platform Selection (Microsoft Intune)
**Purpose:** Record the architectural decision to use Microsoft Intune as the endpoint management platform  
**Scope:** Endpoint, Identity, Security  
**Audience:** Engineers, Architects, Reviewers

---

## Decision ID
- **ID:** DEC-0000
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-22
- **Owner:** Peter Tolvaj

---

## Context
The lab is designed to model a **modern, enterprise-grade workplace architecture** with a strong emphasis on identity-driven access control, device trust, and security-aware operations.

Endpoint management is a foundational architectural component, as device state and compliance are intended to be used as **signals in identity-based access control decisions**.

A dedicated endpoint management platform is required to:
- Act as the authoritative source of device state
- Evaluate and report device compliance
- Integrate with identity and access control mechanisms
- Support cloud-first, modern operating models

This decision is **purely architectural** and intentionally separated from licensing, configuration, and implementation considerations, which are addressed in subsequent decisions and runbooks.

---

## Decision
I decided to use **Microsoft Intune** as the endpoint management platform for this lab.

Intune will function as the **authoritative control plane for endpoint state**, providing device-related signals to identity and access control systems.

---

## Rationale
- Native integration with Microsoft Entra ID
- Designed to provide device compliance and posture as access signals
- Cloud-native architecture aligned with modern enterprise patterns
- Strong alignment with Zero Trust principles
- Widely adopted in Microsoft-centric enterprise environments
- Supports identity-centric security and access enforcement models

This decision ensures endpoint management is treated as a **core architectural capability**, not an auxiliary or optional component.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Reason Rejected |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| Microsoft Configuration Manager (SCCM/MECM) | Mature, feature-rich | On-prem dependency, limited identity integration | Not cloud-first |
| Co-management (SCCM + Intune) | Transitional flexibility | Increased complexity, hybrid focus | Architectural simplicity preferred |
| Third-party MDM (Jamf, Workspace ONE) | Platform specialization | Weaker identity integration | Reduced architectural cohesion |
| No centralized MDM | Minimal setup | No device trust signal | Incompatible with Zero Trust |

---

## Implications

### Positive
- Enables identity-driven access decisions based on device state
- Clear separation between identity, device, and access control planes
- Simplifies architecture by consolidating endpoint management
- Aligns lab design with current enterprise best practices

### Negative
- Requires endpoint management expertise
- Shifts operational mindset from traditional on-prem tooling
- Introduces dependency on a cloud-based control plane

---

## Security Considerations
- Device state becomes an explicit dependency in access decisions
- Misconfiguration could impact user access if not carefully governed
- Emergency and recovery scenarios must be explicitly designed

Compensating principles:
- Emergency access handled via separate identity decisions
- Device-based access controls introduced incrementally in later phases

---

## Rollback / Exit Strategy
If Microsoft Intune is no longer suitable as the endpoint management platform:
- Remove device-based conditions from access control policies
- Revert to identity-only access decisions
- Decommission endpoint enrollment and management
- Update architecture documentation and supersede this decision

This decision does not irreversibly lock the lab into an Intune-dependent design.

---

## Validation

- [x] Platform supports centralized device lifecycle management
- [x] Platform provides device state and compliance as first-class signals
- [x] Platform integrates natively with identity-based access controls
- [x] Platform aligns with Zero Trust architecture principles
- [x] Platform is officially supported and documented by the vendor

Validation was based on:
- Official vendor documentation and reference architectures
- Integration capabilities with identity-based access control
- Alignment with Zero Trust design principles
- Industry adoption and enterprise usage patterns

No device enrollment, policy configuration, or technical implementation
was performed as part of this decision.

Practical and technical validation is intentionally deferred to
subsequent decisions and runbooks.

Licensing, entitlement, configuration, and operational execution
are explicitly addressed in separate decision records and runbooks.
