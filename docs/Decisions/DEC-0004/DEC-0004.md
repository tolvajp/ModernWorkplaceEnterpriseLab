# Decision Log – Account and administrative role model

---

## Decision ID
- **ID:** DEC-0004
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-22
- **Owner:** Peter Tolvaj

---

## Context
The lab aims to model a **realistic, enterprise-grade identity baseline** where access control,
privilege elevation, and security enforcement can be reasoned about and reviewed independently
of specific tooling or policy implementation.

Before defining authentication methods, Conditional Access, or device trust,
it must be explicitly decided **what types of identities exist** in the tenant and
**how administrative privileges are separated from day-to-day usage**.

Without a clearly defined account and role model:
- Privilege boundaries become implicit and error-prone
- Security controls cannot be consistently scoped
- Emergency access and recovery scenarios remain ambiguous

This decision establishes the **identity primitives** that all subsequent security
and access decisions depend on.

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Definition of **account types** used in the tenant
- Separation between **standard usage** and **administrative access**
- Definition of **emergency access identities**
- High-level intent of privilege separation (not enforcement)

### Out of Scope
- Authentication method configuration (MFA, passwordless, etc.)
- Conditional Access policies
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) configuration
- Role assignment mechanics
- Licensing and feature activation
- Automation or provisioning workflows

---

## Decision
The tenant will use a **strictly separated account model** consisting of:

- **Standard user accounts** for daily productivity
- **Dedicated administrative accounts** for privileged operations
- **Emergency access (break-glass) accounts** for recovery scenarios

Administrative privileges will **never** be exercised using standard user accounts.
Each account type has a distinct purpose, risk profile, and security treatment.

---

## Rationale

This model reflects established enterprise security practices by enforcing
a strict authentication baseline while intentionally limiting scope in other
areas.

The decision prioritizes strong, uniform authentication guarantees (MFA,
phishing-resistant methods, explicit break-glass handling) over fine-grained
administrative role segmentation. As a result, least-privilege principles are
applied at the authentication level but are **not fully modeled at the
administrative role level** within this lab.

This trade-off is intentional and allows the lab to focus on authentication
invariants without introducing additional role complexity that belongs to a
separate decision domain.

Key reasons:

- Reduces blast radius by isolating privileged access
- Enables differentiated security controls per account type
- Makes audit, review, and reasoning about access explicit
- Supports the existing PIM-based administrative model, while allowing for
future introduction of Conditional Access enforcement and automation.
- Avoids ambiguous “same user, different hat” privilege usage

The decision intentionally focuses on **conceptual separation**, leaving
technical enforcement to later decisions and runbooks.

---

## Design Principles
- **Least privilege by design**
- **Explicit trust boundaries**
- **Separation of duties**
- **Recoverability**
- **Auditability**
- **Clarity over convenience**

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Reason Rejected |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| Single account per user | Simple, low overhead | High risk, privilege bleed | Incompatible with least privilege |
| Temporary elevation without separate account | User convenience | Blurred trust boundary | Harder to audit and reason about |
| No dedicated emergency accounts | Fewer identities | Poor recoverability | Unsafe in lockout scenarios |
| Tool-enforced separation only | Less documentation | Implicit assumptions | Architecture must be explicit first |

---

## Implications

### Positive
- Clear foundation for MFA, CA, and PIM decisions
- Improved security posture through privilege isolation
- Architecturally reviewable identity model
- Cleaner automation and governance later

### Negative
- Increased identity count
- Slightly higher operational overhead
- Requires user/admin discipline

---

## Security Considerations
- Administrative accounts represent higher-value targets and must be protected accordingly
- Emergency access accounts require special handling to avoid misuse
- Future decisions must ensure that controls do not inadvertently lock out recovery paths

These risks are addressed incrementally in subsequent decisions.

---

## Rollback / Exit Strategy
If this account model is no longer suitable:

- Consolidate identities into a reduced model
- Update dependent decisions (authentication, access control, PIM)
- Remove unused administrative or emergency accounts
- Ensure no residual privileged access remains

Rollback does not affect tenant data or platform integrity.

---

## Validation
- [ ] Account types are explicitly documented
- [ ] Administrative access is conceptually separated from daily usage
- [ ] Emergency access identities are defined
- [ ] No configuration or enforcement is performed as part of this decision

Validation is performed through documentation review only.

## Notes
This decision precedes decisions for PIM, CA, MFA.
Until all needed decisions are made for user creation, this lab will use a default protected global administrator account.
