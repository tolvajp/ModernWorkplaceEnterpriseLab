# DEC-0003 – Custom Domain Introduction and Company Branding

## Decision ID
- **ID:** DEC-0003
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-24
- **Owner:** Peter Tolvaj

## Context
The tenant was initially created using the default `*.onmicrosoft.com` domain.
While technically functional, this domain is not suitable for realistic enterprise
demonstration, user identity modeling, or sign-in experience validation.

Additionally, the default tenant appearance provides no visual or textual distinction,
making it unsuitable for demonstrations, screenshots, and portfolio usage.

## Scope
### In Scope
- Adding a custom verified domain
- Setting the custom domain as primary
- Applying basic company branding (text, banner, square logo, background)

### Out of Scope
- Automatic user UPN changes
- Authentication policies
- Conditional Access
- Identity lifecycle management

## Decision
Introduce the custom domain `modernworkplaceenterpriselab.eu` and apply minimal
company branding to clearly identify the tenant.

## Rationale
- Aligns with real enterprise identity practices
- Improves clarity during demos and screenshots
- Avoids implicit identity changes

## Implications
- Domain ownership verification required
- No impact on existing users unless explicitly changed

## Validation
- Domain verified
- Domain set as primary
- Branding visible in Entra admin center
- Branding visible on Microsoft sign-in page

## Notes
Adding a custom domain does **not** automatically update existing users’ UPNs.
