# Decision Log – Licensing Baseline (Microsoft 365 E5)
**Purpose:** Record the decision to use Microsoft 365 E5 as the licensing baseline for the lab  
**Scope:** Identity, Endpoint, Security  
**Audience:** Engineers, Architects, Reviewers

---

## Decision ID
- **ID:** DEC-0001
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-22
- **Owner:** Peter Tolvaj

---

## Context
The lab is designed to demonstrate **enterprise-grade identity, endpoint, and security capabilities** using Microsoft cloud services.

Licensing is required to:
- Enable advanced identity protection features
- Unlock endpoint management and security capabilities
- Support Conditional Access and Zero Trust scenarios
- Provide realistic enterprise-level functionality without artificial limitations

Licensing is treated as a **commercial and enablement decision**, explicitly separated from architectural platform selection and operational execution.

---

## Decision
I decided to use **Microsoft 365 E5** as the licensing baseline for this lab.

Microsoft 365 E5 provides a comprehensive entitlement set covering:
- Identity governance and protection
- Endpoint management and security
- Compliance and advanced security features

---

## Rationale
- Provides full access to Microsoft Entra ID P2 capabilities
- Includes Microsoft Intune for endpoint management
- Enables Conditional Access, Identity Protection, and PIM
- Supports advanced security scenarios (Defender, risk-based access)
- Closely mirrors licensing used in large enterprise environments
- Available as a trial, reducing cost and procurement overhead

Using E5 avoids fragmented licensing and ensures feature parity across identity, endpoint, and security domains.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Reason Rejected |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| Microsoft 365 E3 | Lower cost | Missing Entra ID P2, reduced security features | Insufficient for advanced scenarios |
| Individual add-ons | Flexible | Complex, fragmented | Increased operational complexity |
| No licensing / Basic | Minimal setup | Severely limited features | Not representative of enterprise environments |

---

## Implications

### Positive
- Full feature availability for identity and endpoint scenarios
- No artificial limitations during lab exercises
- Simplified entitlement model
- Enterprise-realistic environment

### Negative
- Trial-based licensing has time limitations
- Some features may require renewal or cleanup
- Slight overhead in managing trial lifecycle

---

## Security Considerations
- Advanced security features (e.g. Conditional Access, Identity Protection) become available
- Misconfiguration risk increases with feature breadth
- Strong governance and phased enablement required

Mitigations:
- Incremental feature enablement via runbooks
- Clear separation between licensing and configuration decisions

---

## Rollback / Exit Strategy
If Microsoft 365 E5 is no longer available or suitable:
- Transition to alternative licensing combinations (E3 + add-ons)
- Scale down scenarios to available feature set
- Update dependent decisions and runbooks accordingly

Licensing changes do not invalidate architectural decisions.

---

## Validation

- [x] Licensing enables advanced identity features (Entra ID P2)
- [x] Licensing enables endpoint management (Intune)
- [x] Licensing supports Conditional Access and Zero Trust scenarios
- [x] Licensing reflects common enterprise usage patterns
- [x] Licensing is available via trial for lab purposes

Validation is based on official Microsoft licensing documentation and service descriptions.

## Notes
Operational activation of licenses and assignment to users
is handled in dedicated runbooks and automation.
