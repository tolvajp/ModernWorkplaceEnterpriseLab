# Decision Log – Account and administrative role model

---

## Decision ID
- **ID:** DEC-0002
- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2025-12-22
- **Owner:** Peter Tolvaj

---

## Context
The lab aims to model a **realistic, enterprise-grade identity baseline** where access control,
privilege elevation, and security enforcement can be reasoned about and reviewed independently
of specific tooling or policy implementation.

Before defining authentication methods, Conditional Access, PIM, or device trust,
it must be explicitly decided **what types of identities exist** in the tenant and
**how administrative privileges are separated from day-to-day usage**.

Without a clearly defined account and role model:
- Privilege boundaries become implicit and error-prone
- Security controls cannot be consistently scoped
- Emergency access and recovery scenarios remain ambiguous

This decision establishes the **identity primitives** that all subsequent security
and access decisions depend on.

---

## Scope

### In Scope
- Definition of **account types** used in the tenant
- Separation between **standard usage** and **administrative access**
- Definition of **emergency access identities**
- High-level intent of privilege separation (not enforcement)

### Out of Scope
- Authentication method configuration (MFA, passwordless, etc.)
- Conditional Access policies
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) configuration
- Role assignment mechanics
- Licensing and feature activation
- Automation or provisioning workflows

---

## Decision
The tenant will use a **strictly separated account model** consisting of:

- **Standard user accounts** for daily productivity
- **Dedicated administrative accounts** for privileged operations
- **Emergency access (break-glass) accounts** for recovery scenarios

Administrative privileges will **never** be exercised using standard user accounts.
Each account type has a distinct purpose, risk profile, and security treatment.

At this stage, administrative access is represented by a single
**Global Administrator** account type, deliberately avoiding further role segmentation.
---

## Rationale
This model reflects established enterprise security practices and aligns with
Zero Trust and least-privilege principles.

Key reasons:

- Reduces blast radius by isolating privileged access
- Enables differentiated security controls per account type
- Makes audit, review, and reasoning about access explicit
- Supports future introduction of PIM, Conditional Access, and automation
- Avoids ambiguous “same user, different hat” privilege usage

The decision intentionally focuses on **conceptual separation**, leaving
technical enforcement to later decisions and runbooks.

---

## Design Principles
- **Least privilege by design**
- **Explicit trust boundaries**
- **Separation of duties**
- **Recoverability**
- **Auditability**
- **Clarity over convenience**

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Reason Rejected |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| Single account per user | Simple, low overhead | High risk, privilege bleed | Incompatible with least privilege |
| Temporary elevation without separate account | User convenience | Blurred trust boundary | Harder to audit and reason about |
| No dedicated emergency accounts | Fewer identities | Poor recoverability | Unsafe in lockout scenarios |
| Tool-enforced separation only | Less documentation | Implicit assumptions | Architecture must be explicit first |

---

## Implications

### Positive
- Clear foundation for MFA, CA, and PIM decisions
- Improved security posture through privilege isolation
- Architecturally reviewable identity model
- Cleaner automation and governance later

### Negative
- Increased identity count
- Slightly higher operational overhead
- Requires user/admin discipline

---

## Security Considerations
- Administrative accounts represent higher-value targets and must be protected accordingly
- Emergency access accounts require special handling to avoid misuse
- Future decisions must ensure that controls do not inadvertently lock out recovery paths

These risks are addressed incrementally in subsequent decisions.

---

## Rollback / Exit Strategy
If this account model is no longer suitable:

- Consolidate identities into a reduced model
- Update dependent decisions (authentication, access control, PIM)
- Remove unused administrative or emergency accounts
- Ensure no residual privileged access remains

Rollback does not affect tenant data or platform integrity.

---

## Validation
- [ ] Account types are explicitly documented
- [ ] Administrative access is conceptually separated from daily usage
- [ ] Emergency access identities are defined
- [ ] No configuration or enforcement is performed as part of this decision

Validation is performed through documentation review only.

## Notes
This decision intentionally precedes authentication, Conditional Access,
and PIM-related decisions.

Subsequent decisions will define **how** these account types are secured and governed.

This decision intentionally models administrative access at a **single administrative tier**.

While I am fully aware that real-world enterprise environments typically use
**multiple administrative roles and scopes** (e.g. tiered admins, role-specific admins,
privileged service accounts), this lab deliberately starts with a simplified model:

- One **administrative account type**
- Assigned **Global Administrator** privileges
- Separated from standard user and emergency access identities

More granular administrative role separation is considered an **evolutionary step**
and may be introduced in later decisions once the foundational identity model
and access controls are established.
