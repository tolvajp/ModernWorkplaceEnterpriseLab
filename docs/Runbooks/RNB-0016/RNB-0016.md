# Runbook – MFA Authentication Method Capability Baseline (Microsoft Entra ID)

## Status
Executed

---

## Execution

- **Execution type:** Script execution
- **Script:** SCR-0016.ps1
- **Scope:** Authentication method capability baseline
- **Outcome:** Successful

---

## Preconditions
Conditions that **must be true** before execution.

- [x] Related decision (**DEC-0013 — Authentication Baseline: MFA Model**) is in status **Accepted**
- [x] Microsoft Entra tenant is available and accessible
- [x] Operator has sufficient permissions to manage authentication method policies
- [x] No Conditional Access policies enforcing MFA are active yet
- [x] No conflicting runbook modifying authentication methods already executed

---

## Risks & Safety Notes
Describe **known risks**, limitations, and safety considerations.

- Disabling weak authentication methods immediately prevents their use, even if previously registered
- Users relying exclusively on disabled methods may be temporarily unable to authenticate
- No enforcement logic is applied in this runbook; MFA is not newly required by this execution
- Changes are tenant-wide and affect all interactive identities equally

This runbook performs **capability gating only**, not access enforcement.

---

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Preparation

- Confirm that Conditional Access enforcement is intentionally deferred (DEC-0014)
- Review which authentication methods are considered **out of scope** for this runbook
- Capture the initial state of authentication methods for reference (screenshot or export)

---

### Step 2 – Execution

run SRC-0016.ps1 script

---

### Step 3 – Validation

- Confirm that all Category C methods are disabled tenant-wide
- Confirm that Category A and B methods are available
- Verify that no Conditional Access policies were created or modified
- Confirm that sign-in behavior has not changed beyond method availability

---

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Runbook objective achieved (authentication method capability baseline applied)
- [x] No out-of-scope actions performed
- [x] Tenant authentication methods match DEC-0013 expectations
- [x] No Conditional Access enforcement introduced
- [x] Evidence captured where appropriate

---

## Rollback / Exit Strategy

- Authentication methods can be re-enabled or disabled individually via the same policy
- No irreversible changes are made by this runbook
- No identity lifecycle or access enforcement state is modified
- Conditional Access remains untouched and can be introduced independently later

## Evidence & Artifacts

- Screenshot: Authentication methods policy before execution
- Screenshot: Authentication methods policy after execution
- Execution timestamp
- Operator notes (if any)

---

## Notes

- Windows Hello for Business is not managed via the Authentication Methods policy and is intentionally excluded
- Interaction requirements (e.g. number matching) are not enforced in this runbook
- Administrative vs standard user MFA enforcement will be handled via Conditional Access
- Subsequent runbooks will introduce CA-based MFA enforcement aligned with DEC-0014
