# Scope and Limitations

## Scope

This lab focuses on:

- Showing my menthal model, decision structure.
- Showing my documentation skills
- Showing my ability for automations
- Topics covered in simple but coherent, justifiable state respecting scope selection

## Explicitly out of scope

- Covering every feature of M365, Intune.
- Covering topics at enterprise, production ready state.
- Tailoring the topics to business requests. There is no business.
- Multi-tenant management

## Limitations

Lab is created by sole engineer not following any template, external structure.
Lack of business requierements, peer review, and third party input (Company structure, SOC, ..) leads to base decisions.
The lab started at 2025-12-20. Time constraits prevents to design even one topic in full details. (FE: Introducing CA would be a longer project supported by several teams.)

## M365, Intune scope selection

The scope selection is not reflecting production bare minimum. It is reflecting personal preferences.
A topic is not designeed, implemented in full details with approval processes, exclusions, .. It is there to lead implementation, automation efforts. Any topic can be extended later
